## Functional Specification
backend server for Plan-At. Developed with the idea of "API First" to allow multiple variation of frontend/client

## Scenario Description


## Feature Description
Sections of the project:

1. Framework Selection:
    For the framework, we wanted a framework that's easy to use and shorten developemnt cycle; Python can produce some results with fewset lines of code; the FastAPI was created with the idea of "Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface", and as its name, it have relative better performance than other Python based web framework, and we don't really need this server to render actual HTML page. As a result, the dev solely decide to choose FastAPI and set up an enviornment and repo to began development.
2. Project Breakdown: 
    Our next step was to break down our project into multiple packages, and the priority is provide some mock  data for the frontend team.
